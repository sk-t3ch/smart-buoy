## What is an Ocean?

From WikiPedia:

> The **ocean** is the body of [salt water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water) which covers approximately 71% of the surface of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and contains 97% of [Earth's water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth). Another definition is "any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:0-1)
