What are waves?

What systems exists?

## Energy

Wave energy is a good way to look at the system

spectrograms are useful

energy at different frequencies

similar to how music is measured

in music theory you can measure distinct genres from their mel spectrograms

we can do this for wave types

but how do we classify the data
